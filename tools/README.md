A collection of small tools we use!


`trx_monitor.pl`
=======

This is a simple perl script that you can interactively run to try and get a query out of the longest transaction on a specific MySQL server.  A sample invocation would be:
  `./trx_monitor.pl --host db.example.com --collect --kill-trx`
